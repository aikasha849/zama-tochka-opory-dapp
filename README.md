 # 🌀 Tochka opory — Emotional Grounding through Encrypted AI

**Tochka opory** (“Точка опоры” — _Point of Support_) is a therapeutic, privacy-focused dApp built for Russian-speaking users. It offers a soft digital space to reflect, ask deep personal questions, and interact with a mentor-like AI. The app integrates decentralized technology with human-centered design — aiming to support users emotionally, securely, and beautifully.

## 🗣️ Languages & Cultural Intent

This application is designed primarily for **Russian-speaking users**, preserving linguistic and emotional nuance through native phrasing.  
Multilingual support (English and others) is planned for future versions.

## 🔗 Integration with Zama Builder Testnet

We actively tested this project on [Zama’s Builder Testnet](https://www.zama.ai/builder) — the first fully homomorphic EVM network.  
Test logs and contract interactions are documented in [`/testnet-journal`](./testnet-journal).

Builder Testnet goals:

- Exchange encrypted feedback between user and smart contract  
- Journal reflectively, with thoughts remaining confidential  
- Prove emotional use cases for FHEVM — beyond finance  

The project also includes tasks from [Zama’s Guild](https://guild.xyz/zama-builder-guild) to showcase learning and exploration.
